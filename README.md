# chromatized
A dynamic browser theme that adds optional visual motion and depth effects to web pages while preserving content and usability.

Chromatized does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

All visual effects run entirely locally within the browser. No information about websites, browsing activity, or user behavior is accessed, logged, or sent anywhere.

Any settings such as enabled effects or intensity values are stored locally using browser storage and never leave the user’s device.

Chromatized does not use analytics, tracking, remote servers, or third party services.

The extension does not execute remote code. All code is packaged with the extension.
